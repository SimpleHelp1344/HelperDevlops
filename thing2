Below is a tiny Python snippet that will:
	1.	Read your exported sheet CSV (e.g. Sheet1.csv)
	2.	Append the section number onto the ATP Test column
	3.	Keep exactly the columns you asked for:
	•	ATP Test (now with section appended)
	•	Parent
	•	Issue Id
	•	Issue Type
	•	dot count (if that column exists)
	4.	Write out atp_import.csv ready for JIRA

import pandas as pd

# 1. load your raw CSV
df = pd.read_csv("Sheet1.csv")

# 2. append the section to the ATP Test text
#    (no "Summary" column at all)
df["ATP Test"] = (
    df["ATP Test"].astype(str)
    + " "
    + df["ATP Section"].astype(str)
)

# 3. pick only the columns you need
wanted = ["ATP Test", "Parent", "Issue Id", "Issue Type", "dot count"]
# filter to whatever actually exists in your sheet
cols = [c for c in wanted if c in df.columns]
out = df[cols]

# 4. write your JIRA‑ready CSV
out.to_csv("atp_import.csv", index=False, encoding="utf-8")

print(f"Written atp_import.csv with columns: {cols}")

How to use
	1.	Download your Google Sheet as CSV (File → Download → CSV).
	2.	Save the above as make_atp_csv.py in the same folder.
	3.	Run:

python make_atp_csv.py


	4.	Take the resulting atp_import.csv into Jira → System → External System Import → CSV, map the fields, and import.
