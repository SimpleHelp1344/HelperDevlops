Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough of what we’re trying to achieve, why, and how the new block you just pasted works inside your existing validator.py.

⸻

1. The overarching task

You want a single, uniform validator for all your key/value formats—JSON, YAML (including Netplan), libconfig, and simple “key=value” text—rather than three separate classes (JsonValidator, YAMLValidator, DictionaryValidator) each doing its own parsing and diff logic.

Goals:
	1.	Convert any supported file or string into a plain Python dict.
	2.	Compare two dicts the same way every time, reporting:
	•	Keys whose values differ,
	•	Keys missing in “B” (but present in “A”),
	•	Keys extra in “B” (but not in “A”)—optionally ignored.
	3.	Log results in exactly the same pattern you already use (logValidationResults), so callers upstream needn’t change.

⸻

2. How your original validator.py was organized
	1.	An abstract base class Validator that defines:
	•	A validate(...) method signature,
	•	A helper _log(...) to call Logger.log(…),
	•	A helper logValidationResults(...) to inspect a returned [diffs, missing, extras] tuple or a simple True/False.
	2.	Concrete subclasses like:
	•	JsonValidator which parses two JSON strings into dicts, then runs a bunch of private recursion logic to find diffs.
	•	YAMLValidator which loads YAML, dumps back to JSON, then calls JsonValidator.
	•	DictionaryValidator which parses “k=v” lines into dicts, then calls JsonValidator.
	3.	A few non–dict validators (TCPValidator, PingValidator, RegexValidator, RTSPValidator) you’d leave untouched.

The downside: three slightly different converters and three different callers into the diff logic, each of which you have to maintain.

⸻

3. The new unified block

When you paste the block right after your imports and before your existing class Validator(ABC):, you inject three new pieces:

3.1 ConfigLoader

A one-stop loader that says:
	•	“Look at the file extension (or a hint fmt), then pick:
	•	json.loads(...)
	•	ruamel.yaml.safe_load(...)
	•	libconf.loads(...) for libconfig
	•	a simple line-split parser for key=value text”
	•	Returns a Python dict in every case, or raises ConfigLoaderError.

3.2 DiffReport + _compare_dicts

A small data class (DiffReport) that holds three lists:
	1.	different_values → [{ "some.key": [valueInA, valueInB] }, …]
	2.	missing_from_b → [ "some.key", … ]
	3.	extra_in_b → [ "other.key", … ]

The helper _compare_dicts(a, b):
	1.	Builds those three lists by recursing through nested dicts.
	2.	Leaves you with a single tree-walk algorithm for all formats.

3.3 KeyValueValidator

A new subclass of your existing Validator ABC. Its validate(a, b, fmtA=None, fmtB=None, kv_sep="=", ignore_extra=False) does:
	1.	dict_a = ConfigLoader.load(a, fmt=fmtA, kv_sep=kv_sep)
	2.	dict_b = ConfigLoader.load(b, fmt=fmtB, kv_sep=kv_sep)
	3.	rpt = _compare_dicts(dict_a, dict_b)
	4.	If rpt.is_match(ignore_extra), logs “All keys and values match” ⇒ returns True.
	5.	Otherwise, hands back the legacy three-element list [diffs, missing, extras] and calls your original logValidationResults(...) so logging looks identical.

⸻

4. Where exactly to paste
	1.	Open your existing validator.py.
	2.	Locate the top imports:

import re
import json
from ruamel.yaml import YAML
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Union, Any

import collector as collector
from asr.logger import Logger, LogLevel


	3.	Insert the entire “BEGIN – Universal key-value backend” … “END – Universal backend block” snippet immediately below those imports, and above your class Validator(ABC): line.

After that, your old Validator, TCPValidator, JsonValidator, YAMLValidator, etc. remain untouched and in place—so nothing upstream breaks.

5. How to switch callers

Anywhere your code currently does:

JsonValidator.validate(jsonA, jsonB, option)
# or
YAMLValidator.validateFile(pathA, pathB, option)
# or
DictionaryValidator.validateStr(textA, textB, sep, option)

you simply replace with:

KeyValueValidator.validate(jsonA, jsonB)
# or, if you need to force formats:
KeyValueValidator.validate(pathA, pathB, fmtA="yaml", fmtB="json", ignore_extra=True)

The return value and log calls behave just as before:
	•	Returns True if everything matches.
	•	Returns [diffs, missing, extras] otherwise.

⸻

In summary
	•	Task goal: one loader → one comparer → one validator class.
	•	New code block:
	1.	ConfigLoader (any format → dict)
	2.	_compare_dicts + DiffReport (tree-walk diff)
	3.	KeyValueValidator (public facade, logs exactly like before)
	•	Paste it at the top of validator.py (just after imports).
	•	Swap your old three validators for the new one at your leisure.

That’s the full picture—now your config validation is unified, maintainable, and consistent.
